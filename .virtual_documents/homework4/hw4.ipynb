# SyntaxError: expected ':' - Mistake in code that prevents it from functioning properly. I forgot to add ":" following "if" and "else" and fixed it by adding them.
# SyntaxError: invalid character '×' (U+00D7) - Code mistakes that prevent it from functioning properly. Instead of "*," I used "x," and fixed it by making it the correct operator.

# I knew that the function had to return a list or tuple, so I made sure it returned one. I also knew it had to display several different answers to math operators, so I included each one in the list. The function also displays a good function writing processes as everything is organized, variables names make sense, and there is an explanation for the function.
